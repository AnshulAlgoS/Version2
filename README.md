# Version2 AI

Measure the distance between who you are and who you want to become.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Version2 AI is an agentic AI-powered career comparison and progress-tracking platform.
Instead of checking whether a resume is “good enough” using ATS scores, Version2 AI answers a deeper and more practical question:

**“How far am I from becoming the person I look up to — and how long will it realistically take me?”**

The platform compares a user’s current profile with real target profiles (such as a Microsoft engineer, aerospace professional, startup founder, or any role model) and continuously tracks their progress semester by semester.

### ❌ What This Is NOT

*   ❌ Not an ATS resume checker
*   ❌ Not a study planner
*   ❌ Not a roadmap generator
*   ❌ Not a motivational or advice chatbot

### ✅ What Version2 AI Does

*   Compares your resume vs your target person’s resume
*   Calculates skill, project, and experience gaps
*   Estimates realistic time required to reach that level
*   Converts gaps into semester-wise progress
